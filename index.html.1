<p>I'm Matt Lee, an artist &amp; writer living around Boston,
Massachusetts. I moved here in 2008 from the UK. <a

me at Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I previously worked at GitLab, Creative Commons and the Free
Software Foundation. I've been working with free software
professionally since 2001 and I've been using free software since the
90s. All of my work is available under free licenses.</p>

<p>In 2009, I started <a href="https://libre.fm">Libre.fm</a>, a music
community site with a few hundred thousand users. This led to the
creation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre.fm">GNU
FM project</a> to create the software to power the site, which also
led to the creation of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_social">GNU social
project</a>, which later merged with the StatusNet and FreeSocial
projects. I worked on GNU from 2003-2017.</p>

<h2>Other stuff</h2>

<p>Sporadically since the late 90s I've made music with Mark Cousens
(and later Vikki Crowe) 
as <a href="http://furny.co.uk">furny</a>. We have one EP you can buy in various places, including <a
href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/furny/id319940889">iTunes</a>,
<a
href="https://www.amazon.com/More-Mature-Escapades-Hi-Fi-Furny/dp/B002DG179M">Amazon</a>,
<a href="https://furny.bandcamp.com/releases">Bandcamp</a> or as a <a
href="http://furny.co.uk/downloads/_-_-_-_/furny-more-mature-escapades-in-hi-fi-mp3.zip">ZIP
file</a> which comes with some snazzy artwork by <a
href="//robmyers.org">Rob Myers</a>.</p>

<p>I made a film about Free Software in 2007 to promote the 25th
anniversary of the GNU project. <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM8VGiOv_I8">Happy Birthday to
GNU</a> starring Stephen Fry is available on YouTube, and on the <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/fry/">GNU website</a>. My feature film, <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4607980/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk1">Orang-U: An Ape Goes To College</a> comes out in July
2017. Other TV/movie work can be found on my <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6772112/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">IMDb
profile</a>.</p>
